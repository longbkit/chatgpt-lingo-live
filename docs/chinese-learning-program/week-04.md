Week 2: Expanding Conversations and Building Fluency
In Week 2, the focus shifts to expanding your conversational skills by handling more structured dialogues. The AI will guide you through common, everyday situations where you’ll practice asking questions, responding with longer sentences, and using new vocabulary. The goal for this week is to build fluency in basic conversations by practicing common daily scenarios such as shopping, asking for directions, and making small talk.

Day 1-2: Shopping Conversations and Descriptions
Objective: Learn how to ask about items, prices, and make simple transactions in Chinese.

AI Role-Play:

You: “我想买这件衣服。(Wǒ xiǎng mǎi zhè jiàn yīfú.) I’d like to buy this piece of clothing.”
AI: “这件衣服多少钱？(Zhè jiàn yīfú duōshǎo qián?) How much does this clothing cost?”
You: Respond with numbers learned in Week 1, like “五十块钱。(Wǔshí kuài qián.) Fifty yuan.”
Describing Items:

You will practice asking for specific colors and sizes: “你有别的颜色吗？(Nǐ yǒu bié de yánsè ma?) Do you have other colors?”
The AI will ask follow-up questions to keep the conversation going, such as “你要小号还是中号？(Nǐ yào xiǎo hào háishì zhōng hào?) Do you want small or medium size?”
Daily Vocabulary List:

Shopping Vocabulary: 买 (Mǎi – Buy), 衣服 (Yīfú – Clothes), 颜色 (Yánsè – Color), 大 (Dà – Large), 小 (Xiǎo – Small), 钱 (Qián – Money)
The AI will reinforce these words through repetition and context, helping you get comfortable with asking questions in a shopping setting.

Scenario 2: The AI will act as a person you meet on the street. You’ll practice asking for directions to common places, like restaurants or bus stations.
You: “请问，怎么去火车站？(Qǐng wèn, zěnme qù huǒchē zhàn?) Excuse me, how do I get to the train station?”
AI: “直走，然后左转。(Zhí zǒu, ránhòu zuǒ zhuǎn.) Go straight, then turn left.”
The AI will also guide you in giving directions when asked. It might simulate someone asking you, “你知道怎么去商店吗？(Nǐ zhīdào zěnme qù shāngdiàn ma?) Do you know how to get to the shop?”
Listening and Fluency Practice:

The AI will repeat key directions and ask you to respond quickly to improve fluency. You will learn how to use directional words confidently:
左 (Zuǒ – Left), 右 (Yòu – Right), 前面 (Qiánmiàn – In front), 直走 (Zhí zǒu – Go straight)
You will also practice responding to follow-up questions, helping you stay engaged in the conversation.

Building Longer Sentences:

The AI will help you practice forming more complex sentences by combining different phrases you learned earlier. For example, you can ask:
“你平时去哪里看书？(Nǐ píngshí qù nǎlǐ kànshū?) Where do you usually go to read?”

AI Conversation Practice:

The AI will guide you through an extended conversation combining the topics of shopping, asking for directions, and making small talk. You will practice switching topics smoothly.

Once you “arrive,” the AI might ask: “你喜欢看什么类型的书？(Nǐ xǐhuān kàn shénme lèixíng de shū?) What kind of books do you like to read?”

The AI will speed up the pace of conversations to test your listening and response time. You’ll practice replying with minimal pauses, improving your fluency in real-time conversations.
