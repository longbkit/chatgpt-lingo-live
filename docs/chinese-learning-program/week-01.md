Week 1: Core Vocabulary and Pronunciation (Focus on AI-Driven Conversations)
In the first week, we’ll concentrate on building a strong foundation for basic listening and speaking. The AI will be your dedicated language tutor, helping you learn key vocabulary, pronunciation, and simple sentence structures. The goal is to create a solid base in everyday conversational Chinese by focusing on practical, commonly used words and phrases.

Day 1-2: Greetings and Introductions
Objective: Learn how to greet people, introduce yourself, and ask basic questions in Chinese.

AI Role-Play:

The AI will simulate scenarios where you greet others and introduce yourself. You’ll practice:
Saying hello: “你好! (Nǐ hǎo!) Hello!”
Introducing yourself: “我叫... (Wǒ jiào…) My name is...”
Asking simple questions: “你叫什么名字？(Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?) What’s your name?”
Scenario 1: The AI acts as a new friend you’ve just met. Practice greeting them and asking basic information about them.
AI: “你好! 我叫李明. 你叫什么名字？(Nǐ hǎo! Wǒ jiào Lǐ Míng. Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?) Hello! My name is Li Ming. What’s your name?”
You: “我叫…(Wǒ jiào…) My name is…”
Pronunciation Drills:

The AI will focus on correcting your tones in phrases like “你好 (Nǐ hǎo)” and “你叫什么名字？(Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?)”.
You’ll repeat these phrases until you master the correct tones. If necessary, the AI will slow down to help you focus on difficult syllables.
Daily Vocabulary List:

Greetings: 你好 (Nǐ hǎo), 再见 (Zàijiàn – Goodbye), 请问 (Qǐng wèn – Excuse me, may I ask?)
Introduction Phrases: 我叫… (Wǒ jiào…), 名字 (Míngzi – Name), 你呢? (Nǐ ne? – And you?)
The AI will quiz you on these words and phrases at the end of the session, ensuring you remember them.
Day 3-4: Asking and Answering Basic Questions
Objective: Learn to ask and answer common questions about yourself and others.

AI Role-Play:

Scenario 2: The AI will simulate a casual conversation where you ask someone about their occupation or age. You’ll practice:
Asking about someone’s job: “你做什么工作？(Nǐ zuò shénme gōngzuò?) What do you do for work?”
Responding: “我是老师。(Wǒ shì lǎoshī.) I’m a teacher.”
AI will also ask about your age: “你多大了？(Nǐ duō dà le?) How old are you?”
You’ll learn to reply with: “我…岁。(Wǒ … suì.) I’m … years old.”
Listening Practice:

The AI will repeat key phrases for you to listen and imitate, helping you get used to hearing native pronunciation.
After listening to the AI, you will be asked to repeat the phrases, and the AI will correct any mistakes in real time.

AI Role-Play:

Scenario 3: The AI will guide you through a shopping conversation where you ask for prices and learn how to handle numbers.
AI: “这个多少钱？(Zhège duōshǎo qián?) How much is this?”
You: Respond by saying: “五十块钱。(Wǔshí kuài qián.) Fifty yuan.”
You’ll practice asking and answering with different prices.
Pronunciation Focus:

Numbers often involve tricky tonal differences, so the AI will guide you to pronounce numbers like 一 (Yī – One), 十 (Shí – Ten), and 二十 (Èrshí – Twenty) correctly.
The AI will have you repeat these numbers multiple times until you can say them smoothly in sentences.

Day 7: Review and Free Conversation
Objective: Consolidate what you’ve learned in the first week by having a more free-form conversation with the AI.

AI Conversation Practice:

The AI will initiate a free-form dialogue, combining greetings, questions about your occupation, and numbers. You will practice responding to various prompts, similar to real-life interactions.
Example: AI might start with, “你好! 你叫什么名字？(Nǐ hǎo! Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?)” and lead into more questions about your job or age.
Fluency Drill:

The AI will challenge you by speeding up its speech, helping you to process and respond more quickly. You’ll practice listening and replying without too much pause.
